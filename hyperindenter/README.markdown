HyperIndenter
=============

A program to indent html files. It makes no difference between inline tags and
block-level tags, so it indents nice and deep.

Usage
-----

Call the program  with no arguments, and it will  convert  misaligned (or even
malformed) html on its standard  input to nicely aligned and valid html on its
standard output.

When given a  numerical argument, it  indents the standard output by the given
level. This makes it convenient for converting selected pieces of html  from a
text editor (your editor does support piping, right?)
